1.  Introduction

   This document provides recommendations for how IETF Working Groups
   should create IANA registries that are related to cryptographic
   algorithms.  It is based on the lessons learned from the TLS
   registries over the years as described in [RFC8447] and
   [I-D.draft-ietf-tls-rfc8447bis].

   The guidance here can be summarized as follows:

   1.  Each registry SHOULD be "Specification Required," as defined in
       [RFC8126], Section 4.6.

   2.  If required by the "Value" format (see Section 4.1), consider
       reserving a section for Private or Experimental Use.

   3.  Each registry SHOULD have a "Recommended" column (see
       Section 4.4).

   4.  Each registry SHOULD have a "Comments" column (see Section 4.5).

   5.  Most registries will need additional columns.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Specification Required

   The intent of the Specification Required standard for cryptographic
   code points is to allow for relatively easy registration of code
   points associated with protocols and algorithms that are being
   developed outside of IETF or IRTF.  A key requirement is that the
   specification of the semantics must be "permanent and readily
   available" as described in [RFC8126], Section 4.6.  The defining
   document should make explicit if Internet-Draft documents qualify, as
   Section 4.6 does not say.  Authors of the defining document should
   read the entire [RFC8126] and make sure their descriptions and
   requirements are clear.

   Note that the IESG picks the Designated Experts, so they should not
   be named in the defining document.  Instead, specify the number of
   experts and how many are required to approve.  Phrases like "one of
   two" or "two of three" are common requirements for approval.  The
   defining document SHOULD NOT suggest one person, to avoid a single
   point of failure.

   Designated experts ensure the specification is publicly available.
   They may provide more in-depth reviews.  Their review should not be
   taken as an endorsement of the new registry entry.

   When the work is done by an IETF WG or IRTF RG, that group should
   collaborate with the defining WG in order to provide appropriate
   review.  A WG that defines a cryptographic registry MAY wish to
   include text like the following in its instructions to the experts to
   enforce this behavior.  Such instructions should appear in the
   defining document.

   DE Instructions  Unless the WG chairs indicate otherwise via email,
      the Designated Experts should decline code point registrations for
      documents which have already been adopted or are being proposed
      for adoption by IETF working groups or IRTF research groups.

4.  Suggested Columns

   Here is a summary of the recommendation; each column is described in
   its own sub-section below.  The following paragraph can be used as a
   template when defining a registry.

   The columns are defined as follows:

   *  Value (required): The value that appears in the data structure or
      protocol.  Additional sentences that describe the format, such as
      fixed-number of bytes, text string, etc., should be added.

   *  Description (required): A brief description, often pointing to a
      section in the defining Reference.

   *  Reference (required): The publication defining the entry.

   *  Recommended (required): Whether or not this value is recommended
      for general use.

   *  Comments (optional): Text that may be added to explain
      transitions, or similar useful information.

4.1.  The "Value" column

   The "Value" column is the identifier for the cryptographic items in
   the registry.  Every value SHOULD be unique within the registry.
   Values SHOULD only be re-used because of earlier mistakes and if they
   still guarantee there is little to no chance of confusion.

   Sometimes values are inherently unique.  Example of this include ISO
   Object Identifiers, and string identifiers like those in OpenSSH that
   allow an identifier to have an "@domain-name" appended.  It is up to
   the Working Group to decide if such values should be in a registry.
   Values that would have a Recommended value of "Y" probably SHOULD
   appear.

   In some registries, such as TLS Cipher Suites [TLSREG], the values
   are one or more bytes, while NTP uses a single multi-byte value,
   while JOSE uses short text names ([JOSEREG]), such as "s5c" for an
   X.509 certificate chain.

   If a name is not inherently unique, the defining WG MAY wish to set
   aside a specific range or values for "Experimental or Private Use."
   It does not seem necessary to separate "Experimental" from the
   "Private Use" concept.  An example of private string identifiers from
   Sections 3.2 and 3.4 of [RFC6838] are the prefixes "vnd." and "x.",
   respectively.

   Another reason for reserved values is for "greasing" the protocol, to
   help prevent ossification by network devices that do not allow
   protocols to grow and evolve.  See [RFC8701] for more information.
   Such entries are often marked as "Reserved" in their Description, and
   a reference to "RFC8710" in their reference.

4.2.  The "Description" column

   The "Description" is a brief description of the item.  In many cases,
   it will be a short reminder text that should serve as a "guidepost"
   to the reference documentation, as done with the NTP Extension Field
   Types in the NTP Registries, [NTPREG].

4.3.  The "Reference" column

   For work done in the IETF or IRTF, the "Reference" entry will almost
   always point to a RFC about to be published.  For work done outside
   these organizations, the reference should be a URL that the
   Designated Experts have verified to meet the requirements of
   Section 3.

4.4.  The "Recommended" column

   This document specifies that a "Recommended" column be defined, with
   three values that correspond to yes, no, and no opinion.  Specifying
   an initial value of "Y" or "D" in this column MUST require Standards
   Action [RFC8126] for the defining RFC, otherwise the the field MUST
   be empty or have the value of "N".  Not all items defined in
   Standards Track RFCs need to be set to "Y" or "D".

   The entry SHOULD also be left blank for values that are unassigned or
   reserved.

   Y  Indicates that the IETF has consensus that the item is
      RECOMMENDED.  This only means that the associated mechanism is fit
      for the purpose for which it was defined.  Careful reading of the
      documentation for the mechanism is necessary to understand the
      applicability of that mechanism.  When the IETF recommends
      mechanisms that have limited applicability, the working SHOULD
      provide applicability statements that describe any limitations of
      the mechanism or necessary constraints on its use.

   D  Indicates that the item is discouraged.  This marking could be
      used to identify mechanisms that might result in problems if they
      are used, such as a weak cryptographic algorithm or a mechanism
      that might cause interoperability problems in deployment.
      Implementers SHOULD consult the linked references associated with
      the item to determine the conditions under which it SHOULD NOT or
      MUST NOT be used.

   N  Indicates that the item has not been evaluated by the IETF and
      that the IETF has made no statement about the suitability of the
      associated mechanism.  This does not necessarily mean that the
      mechanism is flawed, only that no consensus exists.  The IETF
      might have consensus to leave an items marked as "N" on the basis
      of it having limited applicability or usage constraints.

   Once an entry is created, there are specific requirements to change
   the value.  Cryptographic algorithms become weaker over time, as more
   attacks on them are defined.  Any state transition to or from a "Y"
   or "D" value requires IESG Approval.

   The following is text that can be used in the notes section of any
   registry that has a "Recommended" column:

   Note  If the "Recommended" column is set to "N", it does not
      necessarily mean that it is flawed; but rather that the item
      either has not been through the IETF consensus process, has
      limited applicability, or is intended only for specific use cases.
      If the "Recommended" column is set to "D" the item is discouraged
      and SHOULD NOT or MUST NOT be used.  Defining a "Recommended"
      column value to "Y" or "D" requires Standards Action [RFC8126].
      Any state transition to or from a "Y" or "D" value requires IESG
      Approval.

4.5.  The "Comments" Column

   This is a brief free-text column that can be used to describe
   transitions or limits on usage.  Examples include:

   *  Obsoleted by RFC xxx

   *  Only for TLS 1.3 or later

5.  Security Considerations

   Using Specification Required rather than IETF Review does,
   admittedly, lower the theoretical amount of review provided by a WG.
   Experience has shown, however, that WG members generally provided no
   cryptographic review, especially in the case of referring to national
   cipher suites.

   Recommended algorithms are regarded as secure for general use at the
   time of registration, Over time, however, cryptographic algorithms
   and parameters will be broken or weakened.  It is possible that the
   "Recommended" status in the registry lags behind the most recent
   advances in cryptanalysis.  Implementers and users need to check that
   the cryptographic algorithms listed continue to provide the expected
   level of security.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document is entirely about best practices for defining IANA-
   maintained cryptographic registries.  It does not define any new
   registries but provides guidance to those who need to do so.
